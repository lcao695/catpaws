    <p>
        The built environment constantly amazes me and I truly believe in its potential to transform our lives. As a college student with sensitivity to sensory input, studying and living in comfortable and safe environments is paramount to my academic performance and happiness. Comfortable and adjustable furniture in a classroom, especially for classes that run for extended periods of time like studio classes, allows me to focus on class material, and proper lighting and air circulation keeps me alert and not drowsy. Outside of the classroom, the environment still plays a vital role in work performance, mood, and overall quality of life. I strive to <em>optimize comfort</em> and <em>preserve play</em> in my work.

    <h2> WHAT I COME FROM </h2>

    <p>
        I am currently a sophomore studying <em> Design + Environmental Analysis </em> at Cornell University, but I entered the university as a freshman in the Urban and Regional Studies with a passion for cities, urban design, and the built environment. Taking a D+EA course in my second semester, as well as making friends with several D+EA students, drew my attention to the D+EA program as a great fit for my more hands-on design focus. Now, I'm studying for a future career in ergonomic and affective design, where I hope to make an impact on human health and happiness.
